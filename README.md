# Regional Waste Characterization and Upcycling Chains

[![Banner Image](link-to-your-banner-image)](link-to-your-project-website)

## Introduction

This project, an initiative of SCD Hub, aims to revolutionize waste management by characterizing waste streams and developing sustainable upcycling chains in diverse regions, including Kathmandu, Nairobi, San Jose (Costa Rica), South Sudan, and the Mid-East region. We leverage cutting-edge technologies like Algorand, Supabase, and Leaflet to empower communities and promote environmental sustainability.

Each region presents unique challenges and opportunities in waste management, particularly with regard to upcycling chains. By analyzing waste streams and identifying upcycling potential specific to each region, we aim to uncover valuable insights that support sustainable waste recovery efforts. Additionally, we focus on mapping the size and contents of anthropogenic-managed trash burn activities to protect human health, water quality, and the environment.

## Objectives

1. **Data Gathering & Regional Analysis**: Collect data from publications and local sources on waste volumes, types, and hazards in each target region to form a clear baseline for understanding regional waste streams and potential upcycling opportunities.

2. **Upcycling Chains by Region**: Develop region-specific upcycling opportunities based on local waste materials and needs, focusing on how specific waste streams can be transformed into locally useful products.

3. **Mapping Anthropogenic Trash Burn Activities**: Map the size and contents of trash burn activities in each region to protect human health, water quality, and environmental sustainability.

4. **Community Engagement and Incentives**: Encourage community participation in waste recovery and upcycling initiatives through a transparent and secure reward program using Algorand blockchain technology and Exotopia.org's eco ops check-in system.

5. **Technology Integration**: Utilize blockchain (Algorand), database management (Supabase), and mapping technologies (Leaflet) to ensure transparency, efficiency, and accessibility in waste management processes.

## Methodology

### 1. Regional Waste Volume Estimation

We will estimate waste volumes in each region by analyzing data on population density, waste habits, and regional product consumption:

- **Kathmandu**: Focus on post-consumer plastic waste, especially single-use plastics.
- **Nairobi**: Emphasis on informal waste systems and potential for metal recovery and plastic repurposing.
- **San Jose (Costa Rica)**: Address organic and plastic waste in urban settings, focusing on sustainable agriculture byproducts.
- **South Sudan**: Prioritize scrap metal and construction waste, considering regional conflict and displacement.
- **Mid-East Region**: Characterize waste from reconstruction efforts, including rubble and scrap materials, across various urban and rural areas.

### 2. Field Work and Regional Characterization Regime

- Gather direct measurements of waste types in each region
- Identify region-specific opportunities for upcycling
- Test practical solutions based on available materials
- Map trash burn sites and assess their environmental hazards
- Investigate emissions from burning various materials and assess impacts on local air and water quality

### 3. Upcycling Opportunities by Region

- **Kathmandu**: Upcycle plastic waste into durable building materials or local consumer goods
- **Nairobi**: Transform metal and plastic waste into practical tools, containers, and craft materials
- **San Jose**: Convert organic waste into compost or bio-based materials for sustainable agriculture
- **South Sudan**: Smelt scrap metal into ingots for manufacturing, construction, or transportation
- **Mid-East Region**: Recycle building rubble for construction materials and transform metals into local manufacturing goods, adapting strategies for diverse urban and rural contexts

### 4. Mapping Trash Burn Activities

- Protect human health by identifying hazardous chemical release sites
- Preserve water quality by preventing chemical leaching into water sources
- Contribute to environmental protection by reducing harmful emissions and preventing air and soil contamination

### 5. Incentivizing Local Participation

Utilize Algorand POAP (Proof of Attendance Protocol) tokens and Exotopia.org's eco ops check-in system to reward participants for:
- Attending workshops and training sessions
- Active participation in waste collection and sorting initiatives
- Assisting in mapping and documenting trash burn sites
- Developing and sharing innovative upcycled products or solutions

### 6. Mapping and Technical Infrastructure

- Use Supabase and Leaflet-based mapping system to visualize waste distribution, trash burn activities, and upcycling opportunities
- Integrate with Algorand wallets and Exotopia.org's eco ops check-in system to track upcycling efforts and manage reward distribution

### 7. Testing and Reporting

Compile and analyze regional findings to produce reports detailing:
- Discrepancies between published data and field observations
- Key upcycling opportunities based on local waste streams
- Community participation outcomes and incentive structures
- Impact of anthropogenic trash burning on health, water, and environmental quality
- Practical recommendations for implementing sustainable upcycling programs

### Supabase Integration and RLS Policy

- Connect users' Algorand wallets and Exotopia.org accounts to Supabase profiles
- Implement POAP and NFT ownership verification

Example Supabase function:

```javascript
async function verifyEcoOpsParticipation(userId, tokenId) {
  const { data: user, error } = await supabase
    .from("users")
    .select("algorand_wallet_address, exotopia_account")
    .eq("id", userId)
    .single();

  // Verify POAP or NFT ownership using Algorand indexer and Exotopia.org API
  // Implement logic to check if the user's wallet owns the specified token
}
```





### Leaflet for Mapping

Utilize Leaflet to create interactive maps displaying:
- Waste distribution
- Trash burn sites
- Upcycling centers and opportunities
- Eco ops check-in locations

## Key Objectives

- Reduce landfill waste by 30% in target regions within the first year
- Establish at least 3 sustainable upcycling chains in each location
- Create 100+ green jobs across all project sites
- Develop a replicable model for waste management in diverse urban and rural settings
- Map and assess the impact of at least 50 major trash burn sites across all regions
- Engage 10,000+ community members through the Exotopia.org eco ops check-in system

## Special NFT Partnership with Exotopia.org

As part of our commitment to innovative community engagement, we've partnered with Exotopia.org to integrate their eco ops check-in system into our project. This collaboration enhances our ability to track and reward environmental activities:

- **Eco Ops Check-In System**: Participants can check in to various environmental activities using the Exotopia.org platform, earning unique NFTs for their contributions.
- **Enhanced Tracking**: The system provides detailed insights into community engagement and the impact of individual actions.
- **Gamification of Sustainability**: By earning and collecting NFTs, participants are motivated to consistently engage in waste management and upcycling activities.
- **Cross-Project Synergy**: As both this initiative and Exotopia.org are projects of SCD Hub, this partnership creates a powerful synergy in promoting sustainable development.
