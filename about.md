# Regional Waste Characterization and Upcycling Chains

[![Banner Image](link-to-your-banner-image)](link-to-your-project-website)

## Introduction

This project, an initiative of SCD Hub, aims to revolutionize waste management by characterizing waste streams and developing sustainable upcycling chains in diverse regions, including the greater Nairobi region of central Kenya and the Western United States. We leverage cutting-edge technologies like Algorand, Supabase, and Leaflet to empower communities, promote environmental sustainability, and create lasting, region-specific solutions.

Each region presents unique challenges and opportunities in waste management, particularly regarding upcycling chains. By analyzing waste streams and identifying upcycling potential specific to each region, we aim to uncover valuable insights that support sustainable waste recovery efforts. Additionally, we focus on mapping the size and contents of anthropogenic-managed trash burn activities to protect human health, water quality, and the environment. In the Western United States, a special emphasis will be placed on incorporating native plant gardens alongside the waste management efforts.

## Objectives

1. **Data Gathering & Regional Analysis**: Collect data from publications and local sources on waste volumes, types, and hazards in the greater Nairobi region of central Kenya and the Western United States, with a special focus on native plant gardens in the latter region. The goal is to form a clear baseline for understanding regional waste streams and potential upcycling opportunities.

2. **Upcycling Chains by Region**: Develop region-specific upcycling opportunities based on local waste materials and needs. For example, the Western United States will feature initiatives around reusing specific plastics and incorporating native plant gardening to enhance sustainability.

3. **Mapping Anthropogenic Trash Burn Activities**: Map the size and contents of trash burn activities in each region to protect human health, water quality, and environmental sustainability.

4. **Community Engagement and Incentives**: Encourage community participation in waste recovery and upcycling initiatives through a transparent and secure reward program using Algorand blockchain technology and Exotopia.org's eco ops check-in system.

5. **Technology Integration**: Utilize blockchain (Algorand), database management (Supabase), and mapping technologies (Leaflet) to ensure transparency, efficiency, and accessibility in waste management processes.

## Methodology

### 1. Regional Waste Volume Estimation

We will estimate waste volumes in each pilot region by analyzing data on population density, waste habits, and regional product consumption:

- **Greater Nairobi Region of Central Kenya**: Emphasis on informal waste systems and potential for metal recovery and plastic repurposing.
- **Western United States**: In addition to focusing on specific waste streams such as plastic, this region will incorporate native plant gardens as part of an ecological restoration initiative alongside waste recovery.

### 2. Field Work and Regional Characterization Regime

- Gather direct measurements of waste types in each region
- Identify region-specific opportunities for upcycling, such as incorporating native plant materials in the Western U.S.
- Map trash burn sites and assess environmental hazards
- Investigate emissions from burning various materials and assess impacts on local air and water quality

### 3. Upcycling Opportunities by Region

- **Greater Nairobi Region of Central Kenya**: Transform metal and plastic waste into practical tools, containers, and craft materials
- **Western United States**: Reuse specific plastics for local consumer goods and support local ecosystems by incorporating native plant gardens in waste management efforts

### 4. Mapping Trash Burn Activities

- Protect human health by identifying hazardous chemical release sites
- Preserve water quality by preventing chemical leaching into water sources
- Contribute to environmental protection by reducing harmful emissions and preventing air and soil contamination

### 5. Incentivizing Local Participation

Utilize Algorand POAP (Proof of Attendance Protocol) tokens and Exotopia.org's eco ops check-in system to reward participants for:
- Attending workshops and training sessions
- Active participation in waste collection and sorting initiatives
- Assisting in mapping and documenting trash burn sites
- Developing and sharing innovative upcycled products or solutions
- Enhancing sustainability through the creation of native plant gardens (Western U.S.)

### 6. Mapping and Technical Infrastructure

- Use Supabase and Leaflet-based mapping system to visualize waste distribution, trash burn activities, upcycling opportunities, and the integration of native plants in the Western United States
- Integrate with Algorand wallets and Exotopia.org's eco ops check-in system to track upcycling efforts and manage reward distribution

### 7. Testing and Reporting

Compile and analyze regional findings to produce reports detailing:
- Discrepancies between published data and field observations
- Key upcycling opportunities based on local waste streams
- Community participation outcomes and incentive structures
- Impact of anthropogenic trash burning on health, water, and environmental quality
- Integration of native plant gardens in waste management practices in the Western U.S.
